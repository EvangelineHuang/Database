To Whom It May Concern:

Thank you for your helpful cooperation with our initial work on your new database for ACME. Our initial contact and understanding resulted in a mission statement and objectives for the project holistically. As this is foundational to our work in the future, we would like to ensure that both our understanding and yours match completely, and we encourage any feedback at all. Please refer to the attachments to locate our initial work. 

We would like to ask additional questions to ensure the efficiency and clarity of our work. 

1.	What are the employee policies in terms of scheduling, especially for regular working days, special working days, and emergency or illness policies?
2.	What policies are in place for students that miss tests for any reason?

We appreciate your time and would like to reiterate that a properly working database will save you hours or days in the long run. If you have any concerns or questions, do not hesitate to email or call. Thank you. 

Sincerely, 

Genesis Data Inc.
