The plan should consist of every PHP or HTML page you plan to create, with the following information:


* The file name (example: new_project.php)
* A one-line description of how the page functions in your application (example: This page provides the interface for the user to fill in all the information for a new project)
* What POST or GET variables will it check for upon loading (give these a name, since your team members will need to know what variables to set before loading your new_project.php page)? What are the types of these variables? (Note: There may also be cookies and session variables, but you can modify your plan to include these later.)
* Which team member has primary responsibility for creating the page?
* Which team member has primary responsibility for testing the page? (This could be the same team member or someone else on the team. In general, I think it's better to let someone else test it.)
* Are there any dependencies? For example, if you reach new_project.php from index.php, then you should probably write index.php first. 
* What is your target date for having the PHP page operational?
